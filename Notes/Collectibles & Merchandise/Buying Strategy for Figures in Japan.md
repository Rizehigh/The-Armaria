## 📍 1. Locations

Japan’s figure havens are mostly clustered in otaku-dense neighbourhoods:
#### Tokyo

- **Akihabara**
    - **Best shops**:
        - **Mandarake Complex** – basement to top floor, sorted by rarity & category.
        - **Liberty 8, 9, 10** – dense shops with tons of pre-owned scales at markdown.
        - **Lashinbang** – decently-priced opened figures.
        - **AmiAmi Akihabara** – large, new, usually full of scale displays.
        - **Suruga-ya Akihabara** – often cheaper than AmiAmi, but a bit cluttered.

#### Osaka

- **Den-Den Town (Nipponbashi)**
    - Similar shops to Akiba: Mandarake, Jungle, Lashinbang, Sofmap.
    - Slightly **cheaper prices** than Tokyo due to lower tourist pressure.

#### Nagoya / Fukuoka / Sapporo

- Each has a **Mandarake**, Surugaya, & Book-Off Plus. Great if you’re off the beaten path.

## 🎯 2. Stores

#### 🧙‍♂️ Mandarake

- Renowned for its extensive selection of **mid-tier to high-end pre-owned scales**.
- Figures are meticulously graded & priced according to factors like box condition, rarity, & demand.
- Check the store's floor directories, which typically organise figures into categories such as:
    - 美少女フィギュア (Bishoujo figures)
    - スケール (Scale figures)
    - ガレージキット (Garage kits)

#### 🛍 Lashinbang & Suruga-ya

- Known for a **wide range** of **new & pre-owned figures**, often at discounted prices.
- Pre-owned figures are typically graded based on condition, with some missing original packaging or showing minor imperfections.
- Shops often feature **rare** or **limited edition** items, making them great for finding older or popular figures.

#### 📦 Book-Off / Hobby-Off / Hard-Off

- Go to the larger Book-Off Plus stores—they have surprisingly good **hidden gems**.
- Often **undervalued**, especially in rural or non-tourist areas.

#### 💀 Expensive: Animate, [[Kotobukiya]], & Akiba Culture Zone

- These sell **mostly new stock at retail or above**.
- Fine for window shopping or exclusives, but not for bargains.

## 💡 3. How to Identify Good Deals

- Look for **箱無し (no box)** or **訳あり (defects)**: prices drop 20–60%, even if the defect is trivial.
- Use your phone to check the price on **MyFigureCollection** or **AmiAmi** as a baseline.
- If a scale is **<60% of its original price** & in good shape, it's a green flag.
- Mandarake & AmiAmi offer **tax-free service** if you show your passport.

## 🔍4. How to Judge Quality (Prize vs Non-Prize)

#### 🪞The **face** is the soul of a figure. Low-quality ones often botch this.

Look for:

- **Clean, crisp, detailed eye prints**—no smudges, misalignment, or fading.
- **Nose & mouth symmetry**—some cheap ones skew proportions.
- **Emotion**—does the face convey personality or feel flat?

>Even high-detail outfits can’t redeem a dead-eyed face.

---
#### 🎨**Paint** reveals whether love—or haste—was poured into the figure.

Pay attention to:

- **Paint bleed or overflow** (e.g., hair colour spilling onto forehead)—indicative of low-quality craftmanship.
- **Subtle shading** on skin, hair, & folds—flat paint signals cheap production.
- **Gloss control**—matte skin with glossy eyes is ideal. If everything shines like plastic, it’s poor quality.

>Prize figures often lack shading—everything is the same tone.

---
#### 🗿A good sculpt isn’t just clean—it’s **dynamic, full of depth**.

Watch for:

- Flowing hair with **individual strands**, not just clumps.
- Folds in fabric that feel **organic**, not stamped on.
- Accessories with **detail**: buttons, clasps, ribbons.

> Alter, [[Good Smile Company|GSC]], [[Kotobukiya]], etc., excel here—prize figures tend to be stiff, lifeless.

---
#### ⚖️A quality figure feels **alive** in its stance. You should be able to feel the weight of their motion

- Dynamic poses ≠ unstable. Check if they lean or wobble.
- Can it stand confidently without obvious pegs? A sign of great base engineering.

---
#### 🧱 The **base design**

Prize figure bases are typically:

- Circular or hexagonal in shape.
- Made from flat, single-colour plastic.

In contrast, high-quality figures often feature:

- Custom sculpted bases, incorporating elements like tiles, rocks, or splashes.
- Painted textures that enhance depth & realism.
- A seamless integration with the character, creating a cohesive & dynamic presentation.

---
#### 🧠**Material** feel

Figures in display cases likely cannot be touched, but if one is bought:

- Higher-quality PVC/ABS is **felt as sturdy but not brittle**.
- Cheap figures are sometimes **felt as rubbery, hollow, or oddly shiny**.
- The weight can **hint at quality**, but caution is advised—some resin kits are light too.
