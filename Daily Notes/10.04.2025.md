Hey y'all.

Yes, I know, I did not make a list of figures I want. There are a couple reasons, but let's just say there were more important things to do (there is so many to go through so it is really difficult). The ones that look good are expensive, but the biggest problem is that there are only a few that I like. Especially for Monogatari, where there are almost no good figures. 

Anyways, what I did do today was research a bit into the logistics of the supposed [[Trip to Japan 2025]]. Yeah. It is not super expensive, but yeah. About 3000 AUD per person if we are to be light. More so 4000 AUD because we wanna buy stuff (I wanna buy stuff). Turns out December is not the best time to be travelling, especially not in East Asia, but what can I do.


I will be reviewing the figures in my wishlist soon I promise
