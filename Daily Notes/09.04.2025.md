Hello everyone. 







I have finally come to a conclusion on what figures I want to buy, or at least what characters I want to buy. I want to buy every character from Monogatari, some vocaloid figures (mainly Hatsune Miku), & Maomao from The Apothecary Diaries. If I come across a perfect Frieren figure I am happy to buy as well but I am content with restricting myself to that. Maybe a couple Spy × Family figures as well, but I already have one so yeah.
