Hello everyone. Today I wrote a good amount. Much less than the last two days though. I will not beat that in the near future. Anyways, I did the biology 5A edrolo today, & then spent a large amount of the day researching improvements to Obsidian. I have started using tags more expertly, started syncing my Obsidian with Git instead of syncthing because of some conflicts, backed up my Obsidian to a proton drive, added Iconize 







I have finally come to a conclusion on what figures I want to buy, or at least what characters I want to buy. 
I want to buy **every character** from **Monogatari**, **some vocaloid** figures (mainly Hatsune Miku), & **Maomao** from The Apothecary Diaries. If I come across a perfect **Frieren** figure I am happy to buy as well but I am content with restricting myself to that. Maybe a couple **Spy × Family** figures as well, but I already have one so yeah. I mean, reasons for this is still feeling a little guilty when spending money, & the fact that there are not many figures that I think are good enough to buy. I can be very picky when I want to.
