## Structure of Insulin

 - Insulin is a small protein with just **51 amino acids** in two separate peptide chains called chain A & chain B
	 - **Chain A: 21** amino acids long. 
	 - **Chain B: 31** amino acids long. 
- The chains are held together by **two disulfide bonds** between **cysteine amino acid residues**.
## [[recombinant plasmid]] Construction (A Chain)

1. A vector plasmid is engineered with tetR & ampR **selectable marker** genes & BamHI & EcoRI restriction sites. 
2. Human insulin is separated & A chain gene, as well as DNA ligase, is introduced to the plasmids. 
	- Insulin A & B subunits genes do not have introns (see [[4E - Recombination & Transformation|here]]), & have **methionine amino acid added** to the beginning/front.
	- BamHI cleaves the tetracycline resistance gene disrupting expression in a [[recombinant plasmid]]. 
3. The plasmids are added to bacteria (*E. coli*).
4. Bacteria is grown on an **ampicillin** plate to select transformed bacteria
	- Non-transformed bacteria die
5. Surviving colonies are scraped on a plate with **tetracycline**.
	- Colonies that **do not grow** have a [[recombinant plasmid]] (TetR gene is disrupted by BamHI)
	- Colonies that **grow** have a nonrecombinant plasmid (TetR gene intact).
6. Recombinant bacteria are lysed, then recombinant plasmids are purified, treated with **EcoRI**, & then **LacZ reporter gene** minus a **STOP codon** is introduced
	- LacZ produces **β-galactosidase** which cleaves **X-gal** into **galactose** & **indole**, which turns recombinant bacteria **blue**.
7. New recombinant plasmids are added to bacteria. Those that turn blue are cultured.
8. LacZ has no STOP codon, thus, when transcribed & translated, creates a fusion protein with InsA, **β-gal-InsA fusion protein**. Enzymes in bacteria degrade small unfolded peptides but won't degrade a large protein.
9. The insulin is cut from the fusion protein by mixing with **cyanogen bromide** which breaks down **methionine**, not present in insulin. Insulin A & B chains are mixed together, forming **disulfide bonds**, spontaneously forming human insulin (quaternary protein).

The LacZ gene, & hence the InsA gene, is repressed by a repressor protein at the operator. This allows geneticists to control expression by adding allolactose (or other compounds) which binds to the repressor protein, undergoing a conformational shape change to unblock the operator allowing RNA polymerase to transcribe mRNA. A ribosome then creates β-gal-InsA fusion protein.

As there is no methionine in the entire InsA gene, a methionine is added to the front of the InsA gene to allow separation between β-galactosidase & InsA. This happens by mixing with cyanogen bromide which breaks down methionine releasing insulin A chain from the β-galactosidase protein.

1. **Plasmid Preparation** : A vector plasmid is engineered with **selectable markers** (ampicillin & tetracycline resistance genes) & restriction sites for BamHI & EcoRI.
2. **Gene Insertion** : Human insulin genes (A & B chains) are isolated **without introns**, with **methionine added** at the start. [[restriction enzymes]] cut both plasmid & insulin genes, & **DNA ligase** joins them to form **recombinant plasmids**.
3. **Transformation** : The recombinant plasmids are introduced into _E. coli_ bacteria through heat shock.
4. **Selection** : Bacteria are grown on ampicillin plates. Only those with plasmids survive. Surviving colonies are tested on tetracycline plates. Colonies that don't grow have recombinant plasmids (tetR gene disrupted by BamHI).
5. **Reporter Gene** : Recombinant plasmids are treated with EcoRI, & a LacZ reporter gene cut with the same enzyme is inserted. Bacteria turning blue on X-gal plates indicate successful recombination.
6. **Protein Production** : Bacteria produce a **β-galactosidase-insulin** fusion protein. **Cyanogen bromide** cleaves methionine, releasing insulin chains.
7. **Insulin Formation** : Insulin A & B chains are mixed, forming **disulfide bonds** to create functional human insulin.
