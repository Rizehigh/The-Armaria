When a double-strand break occurs in DNA, the cell will try repair it. 

## Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ)

- If no homologous copy is available, the cell repairs the break with **NHEJ**. 
- This is **error-prone** & often results in **mutations**. Exonucleases will often remove nucleotides whilst it tries to join back together.
- Mutations can **knocks-out** a gene, rendering it non-functional.
- This is often used to study gene function & impact of a gene on an organism.

## Homology-Directed Repair (HDR)

- If a **homologous copy** is available, the cell will use it as a template to accurately repair the break. 
- HDR is much less error-prone than NHEJ.

There are several different processes, but the simplest is **synthesis-dependent strand annealing** (SDSA):

1. The 5' ends of both strands are **re-sectioned**, leaving sticky ends
2. An enzyme will unwinds the homologous DNA, forming a **D-loop**, & the 3' overhang are dragged down & paired with the complementary sequence on the homologous DNA. 
3. DNA polymerase will **extend** the 3' end using the template strand until it reaches a chi site (where the 5' end 'starts')
4. The extended strand is disengaged & ligated to the other broken end.
5. The second strand is extended by DNA polymerase.

Scientists use genes with homology arms
