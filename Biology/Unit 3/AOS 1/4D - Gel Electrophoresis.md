## Purpose:
 
 - Sorts DNA fragments by the length of fragment to allow comparison between samples or to measure the DNA fragment length.

## Preparing the Gel:

Made from laboratory grade [[agarose gel]]. Melted in a microwave & poured into a tray. A comb is inserted at one end to create wells. As the gel sets, it forms a porous structure at the microscopic level through which fluids (& DNA) can move.
## Loading the Gel:

1. The gel sits in an electrophoresis tank, & is then covered in buffer
2. The amplified DNA together with a [[loading dye]], is carefully pipetted into the wells at the negative electrode of the electrophoresis tank
3. As DNA is negatively charged due to its phosphate, it will move away from the negative electrode once the power supply is turned on
4. After running for an amount of time, the gel is removed & stained with ethidium bromide
5. The DNA bands fluoresce under UV light, & smaller fragments move further than longer fragments.
