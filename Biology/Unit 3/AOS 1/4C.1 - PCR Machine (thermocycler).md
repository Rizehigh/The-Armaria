The [[4C - Polymerase Chain Reaction|PCR]] Machine, also known as a thermocycler or thermal cycler, amplifies DNA typically by **cycling** through **three temperatures**.
## How?

| Temperature  | Effect                                                                                                                                             | Name                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| 95°C (>87°C) | DNA is denatured as heat breaks hydrogen bonds between complementary nitrogenous bases. The hydrogen bonds can be reformed between the two strands | Denaturing            |
| 55°C         | Primers anneal to complementary nucleotide sequences at the 5' ends of the DNA strands, providing binding sites for [[Taq polymerase]]             | Annealing             |
| 72°C         | [[Taq polymerase]] extends primers. 72°C is the optimal temperature of [[Taq polymerase]]                                                          | Extension/ Elongation |
	
Tubes placed in the thermocycler contain a buffer mixed with:

- The DNA to be amplified (DNA template)
- [[DNA primers]]
- [[Taq polymerase]]
- DNA nucleotides ([[dNTPs]])
- Buffer solution
- MgCl$_2$ 

With each cycle of the thermocycler, the number of copies of the region of interest **doubles** (2$^n$, geometric growth). After about 20–30 cycles, there will be millions of copies (2$^{20}$ > 1 million, 2$^{30}$ > 1 billion) & almost all of the copies will *just* be the region of interest.
