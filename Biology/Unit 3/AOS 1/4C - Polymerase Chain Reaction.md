## Purpose

- **Rapidly amplifies** specific (relatively small) DNA segments, usually 100â€“10,000bp. Maximum length that can be amplified is **40,000 bp**.
- Why?
	- To detect hereditary disease
	- To match a suspect to DNA linked to a crime
	- To identify the parents of a child

## How?
 
 - A **region of interest** is identified
 - A **~25 base sequence** at the **3' end** of both strands of DNA in the region of interest is identified
 - **[[DNA primers]]** are created - complementary ~25 base sequences using a DNA synthesiser or by ordering online
 - A **[[4C.1 - PCR Machine (thermocycler)|thermocycler]]** is used.
