## Why Use a [[recombinant plasmid]]?

-  Easy to obtain & reproduce quickly

## Creating Recombinant Plasmids:

1. A gene of interest **without introns** is obtained either by 
	- a DNA synthesiser or
	- the use of reverse transcriptase to transcribe **cDNA** from mRNA, then [[restriction enzymes]] to cut out the gene of interest.
2. A plasmid is chosen with:
	- Two genes that encode observable traits (**reporter genes**), with one containing the restriction site of the [[restriction enzymes|restriction endonuclease]] is chosen
	- An Origin of Replication, a sequence that signifies the start site for DNA replication.
3. The same [[restriction enzymes|restriction enzyme]] is used to cut both the source gene & plasmid so they have complementary sticky ends
4. Ligase is added, & some plasmids incorporate the source gene to form a [[recombinant plasmid]]
5. Bacteria are made competent to take up plasmids through heat shock & electroporation. Only some will take up a plasmid. Fewer will take up a [[recombinant plasmid]].
6. Bacteria is grown on an agar plate containing the antibiotic (ampicillin). Bacteria that have not taken up a plasmid will not grow. Bacteria which does not glow in the dark are then transferred to another agar plate to finish gene cloning.
