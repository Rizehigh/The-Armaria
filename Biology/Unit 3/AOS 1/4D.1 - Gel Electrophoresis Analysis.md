## Heterozygous vs Homologous:

Each person will have either two bands if they are heterozygous, or one band if they are homozygous.
## Molecular Weight Ladder aka Standard Ladder

Uses **known DNA fragment lengths** to create a **baseline of comparison** to allow **measurement** of the size of unknown DNA fragment lengths.
## Positive Control 

A sample of **known DNA** is amplified using [[4C - Polymerase Chain Reaction|PCR]]. 
- If there is a band in the lane then [[4C - Polymerase Chain Reaction|PCR]] has no issues
- If there is no band in the lane then issues with [[4C - Polymerase Chain Reaction|PCR]] or DNA extraction have occurred.
## Negative Control 

Everything in put into the [[4C.1 - PCR Machine (thermocycler)|PCR Machine]] except DNA. 
- If there are no bands there is no contamination of the [[4C - Polymerase Chain Reaction|PCR]] mixture 
- If there are bands, there could be contamination or non-specific amplification.

In Australia, forensic investigations use a kit called "Profiler Plus", which tests 9 [[short tandem repeats|STRs]]. Each person has two numbers for each [[short tandem repeats|STR]], representing their two alleles for that gene (one from each parent) & showing as two bands in the gel (or one if they have the same alleles, which is unlikely).
