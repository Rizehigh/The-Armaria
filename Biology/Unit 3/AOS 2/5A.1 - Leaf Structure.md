Leaves are specialised to accumulate the **reactants** necessary for photosynthesis:

- The **upper epidermis** is layered with **palisade mesophyll cells**, replete with **chlorophyll** to absorb solar energy—hence the darker hue on the upper surface.
- The **lower epidermis** is dotted with **stomata**, which regulate gas exchange—permitting **CO₂** influx while mitigating water loss.
- **Water** is drawn from the soil via **xylem** vessels in the **vascular bundle**.
- **CO₂** diffuses upwards through the **spongy mesophyll** to reach **mesophyll cells**.
- The **cuticle**, a waxy layer secreted by **epidermal cells**, impedes the escape of gases & water.
