## Why Photosynthesis Occurs

Photosynthesis captures **light energy** from sunlight to convert it into **chemical energy** in the form of a 6C sugar, glucose, using **carbon dioxide** & **water**, producing **oxygen** as a by-product.

Plants are **photoautotrophs**—organisms that synthesise their own food using light energy instead of consuming organic matter.

## Where Photosynthesis Occurs

Photosynthesis occurs in two stages in the **chloroplasts** of plants & algae. The **light-dependent** stage takes place in the **grana**, on **thylakoid membranes**. The **light-independent** stage takes place in the **stroma**. 

## Photosynthesis Equations:

All of the reactions are catalysed by **[[RuBisCO]]** with the help of [[cofactors]]. 

**Balanced Overall Photosynthesis Equation:**$$6CO_2 + 6H_2O \xrightarrow[\text{chlorophyll}]{\text{light}} C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2$$
**True Overall Photosynthesis Equation:**
$$6CO_2 + 12H_2O \xrightarrow[\text{chlorophyll}]{\text{light}} C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 + 6H_2O$$​​
> Note that light & chlorophyll facilitate the reaction but are neither reactants nor products.

## Light-Dependent Stage

**Location:** Thylakoid membranes
- **Inputs**: 12H₂O, 12NADP⁺, 18ADP + 18 Pᵢ
- **Outputs**: 6O₂, 12NADPH, 18ATP

**Process:**
1. Light energises electrons in chlorophyll.
2. **Photolysis** splits water into O₂ (released), H⁺ ions, & electrons.
3. **Electron Transport Chain** transfers electrons, releasing energy.
4. Energy pumps H⁺ ions into the thylakoid lumen, creating a **proton gradient**.
5. As 12 H⁺ diffuses (facilitated diffusion) through, **ATP synthase** (carrier transmembrane protein) catalyses formation of 18 ATP molecules.
6. 12 NADP⁺ combines with electrons & 12 H⁺ ions to form NADPH.

**Purpose:** Generate ATP & NADPH to power the subsequent Calvin Cycle.  
**Condition:** Requires light & chlorophyll.

## Light-Independent Stage (Calvin Cycle)

Forms glucose & water from carbon dioxide & energy

**Location:** Stroma
- **Inputs**: 6CO₂, 12NADPH, 18ATP
- **Outputs**: C₆H₁₂O₆, 6H₂O, 12NADP⁺, 18ADP + Pᵢ

**Process:**
1. CO₂ splits into oxygen & carbon.
2. Half the oxygen attach to carbon.
3. The hydrogen attaches to oxygen.
4. **Carbon Fixation**: 6 CO₂ combines with a 6 5C compound (**RuBP**), forming 6 unstable 6C intermediates, which split into 12 3C (**3-PGA**) compound.
5. **Reduction**: 3-PGA is converted into **G3P** using:
    - Energy from 12ATP (→ 12ADP + 12Pᵢ),
    - Electrons & H⁺ from 12NADPH (→ 12NADP⁺).    
6. 2 G3P exits to form 6C glucose.
7. 10 G3P (the remainder) **regenerates** 6 5C RuBP using 6ATP (→ 6ADP + 6Pᵢ), sustaining the cycle.

**Purpose:** Generate glucose 
**Condition:** Requires light-dependent reactions to have occurred.

##### Process simplified with the Factory analogy:

1. 12 water molecules go into the factory (light dependent stage)
2. Using the power of sunlight, the oxygens are removed forming 6 oxygen gas molecules, leaving 24 H⁺ ions
3. The 24 H⁺ ions go into the light independent stage
4. 6 carbon dioxide molecules are taken in from the atmosphere
5. 1 glucose molecule & 6 water molecules are formed.
