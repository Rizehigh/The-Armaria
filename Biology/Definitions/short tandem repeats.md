**Hypervariable regions** of DNA in humans, containing short sequences of DNA (usually 2-5bp) that are repeated numerous times (e.g. GATGATGATGATGATGATGATGATGAT). Found in **non-coding regions** of DNA. 

In Australia, forensic investigations use a kit called "Profiler Plus", which tests 9 STRs. Each person has two numbers for each STR, representing their two alleles for that gene (one from each parent) & showing as two bands in the gel.

In countries with larger populations, more STRs are used.
