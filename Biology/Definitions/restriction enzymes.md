Enzymes that **cleave DNA** at **specific restriction sites**. Each restriction enzyme is very specific to a particular recognition site, which is usually a 6-base ==palindromic sequence==.

Some cut at the same place on both strands (the centre), leaving blunt ends, whilst others cut at different positions, leaving sticky ends with complementary overhanging nucleotides.

Blunt ends:
- Used in [[4D - Gel Electrophoresis|Gel Electrophoresis]] to keep DNA fragments separate.

Sticky ends:
- Used when there is a need to join DNA fragments.

Their names usually come from the bacteria they come from.

Bacterial restriction enzymes will not cut its own DNA as it will not have the recognition site.
