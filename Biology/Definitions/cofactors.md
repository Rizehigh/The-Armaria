Some enzymes require **non-protein molecules**, known as **cofactors**, to function properly. These help enzymes catalyse reactions by:

- Stabilising substrate binding,
- Participating in the chemical reaction.

**Coenzymes** are a subset of cofactors—**organic**, non-protein molecules that **carry chemical groups**, **electrons**, or **energy** during enzymatic reactions. They are **recycled**, not consumed.

[[RuBisCO]] requires two coenzymes to function, ATP & NADPH
#### ATP: Adenosine Triphosphate
A universal coenzyme that carries **energy**.
- **Structure**: Adenine (nitrogenous base) + ribose sugar + **three phosphate groups**.
- When the terminal phosphate is cleaved (→ ADP + Pᵢ), energy is released for use in biochemical reactions.
- **Used in** both light-independent reactions (e.g., Calvin Cycle) & light-dependent reactions (ATP is produced there).

#### NADP⁺ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate)
A coenzyme that **transports electrons & hydrogen ions**.
- **Structure**: Two nucleotides (one with **adenine**, one with **nicotinamide**) linked via phosphate groups.
- **Reduced to** NADPH during the light-dependent stage (by accepting H⁺ & 2e⁻).
- **Used in** the light-independent stage to **reduce 3-carbon molecules** in the Calvin Cycle.
