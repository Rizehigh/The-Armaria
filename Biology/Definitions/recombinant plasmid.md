A plasmid containing foreign 'passenger' DNA is called a recombinant plasmid.

## Why use a plasmid?
1. **Self-Replication** : Plasmids can replicate independently within a bacterial cell, ensuring that the inserted gene is copied & passed on during cell division.
2. **Small Size** : Their small size makes them easy to manipulate in the lab.
3. **Antibiotic Resistance Genes** : These genes allow for the selection of successfully transformed cells, as only those with the plasmid will survive in antibiotic-containing media.
4. **Multiple Cloning Sites** : Plasmids often have sites for various [[restriction enzymes]], facilitating the insertion of foreign DNA.
